# Playbook XR Gizmo

A simple unity project for prototyping a runtime object gizmo. Currently built for PC only.
The test scene creates a simple object at runtime that represents a `Playbook-Object` type.
Clicking on the object sets the runtime gizmo to that object.

The gizmo supports moving, scaling, and ~~rotating~~ any object that it's attached to. (The gizmos should be switched 🤦‍♂️)

> The movement from the pointer needs to be cleaned up so it doesn't snap to everything...🙈
