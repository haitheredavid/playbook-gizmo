# Playbook XR Gizmo

A simple unity project for prototyping a runtime object gizmo. Currently built for PC only.

The test scene creates a simple object at runtime that represents a `Playbook-Object` type. Clicking on the object sets
the runtime gizmo to that object.

The gizmo supports moving, scaling, and rotating any object that it's attached to. The gizmo is "_procedurally_"
generated so it can automatically refit to any size object.


> The movement from the mouse event to scaling and moving is a bit hacky little sketchy 🙈
